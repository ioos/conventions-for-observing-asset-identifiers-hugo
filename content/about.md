The IOOS Convention for Asset Identification describes rules that are used by the IOOS program to assign identifiers to IOOS-related observing assets including measurement stations, sensors, and processes.  IOOS identifier is the name by which further metadata about the asset may be requested from IOOS web services. <br><br>Apart from the IOOS, each asset may also be identified by other communities, and many assets have numbers or labels assigned to them by an external authority. For example, every weather buoy has a World Meteorological Organization (WMO) number. The IOOS identifiers allow for and make use of such identifiers. However, rather than merely use the number (e.g., 42001) which could refer to a buoy in the Gulf of Mexico or the postal code for Paducah, Kentucky or the section of the California Vehicle Code that describes fines imposed for moving violations, the IOOS identifiers add some semantics to indicate (a) the authority which assigned the number or name and (b) that the asset is somehow associated with IOOS. Being "associated with IOOS" in this context typically means that data from that asset could be discovered or accessed through the IOOS data management layer.
