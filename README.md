## This branch contains draft versions of the IOOS Conventions for Observing Asset Identifiers


The _**IOOS Conventions for Observing Asset Identifiers**_ document describes the conventions used by the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) program to assign an identifier to IOOS-related observing assets including measurement stations, platforms and sensors.  An identifier is used as the name by which further metadata about the asset may be requested from IOOS web services. An IOOS identifier is the name that IOOS web services uses for the asset, but each asset may also have other names assigned by other communities.
